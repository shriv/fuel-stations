# Introduction
TO DO

# Components
- ipynb: the main analysis; an annotated, executable report. 
- html: manually generated by converting ipynb with nbconvert.
- templates: Templating applied to html.
- stylesheets: style attributes of html.
- assets: figures to be embedded in the annotated report.

# Generating HTML
- The html is generated with the following command:
jupyter nbconvert --to html --template=./custom.tpl Fuel\ Stations\ Analysis.ipynb 
- Sinc the stylesheet is in the same folder as the HTML, it's applied automatically.
- TODO:
-- I'd like to refactor the template and stylesheets to their own folder in the repo.
